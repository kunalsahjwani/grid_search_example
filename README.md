README: Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV (XGBoost)

📄 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV on an XGBoost classifier model. It applies standard scaling and builds a pipeline to automate preprocessing and model fitting. The goal is to find the optimal set of hyperparameters to improve the classifier's performance.

🛠️ Features
Uses GridSearchCV for systematic hyperparameter optimization.

Integrates XGBClassifier with StandardScaler in a pipeline.

Evaluates model performance using cross-validation.

Prints the best parameters and corresponding score.

📦 Requirements
Make sure to have the following packages installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy
📁 Files
grid_hyper.ipynb: Main notebook containing the code for hyperparameter tuning.

🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or any compatible environment.

Run all cells sequentially.

The notebook will:

Load and preprocess the data.

Set up the hyperparameter grid.

Fit the pipeline with GridSearchCV.

Print the best hyperparameters and the best cross-validation score.

🧪 Hyperparameters Tuned
The following hyperparameters are searched using grid search:

xgb__n_estimators: Number of boosting rounds

xgb__max_depth: Maximum tree depth

xgb__learning_rate: Step size shrinkage

xgb__subsample: Subsample ratio of training instances

You can customize or expand this grid based on your specific dataset and goals.

📊 Output
The notebook prints:

Best hyperparameters selected by GridSearchCV

Corresponding best score (cross-validation score)

python
Copy
Edit
print("Best Parameters:", grid.best_params_)
print("Best Score:", grid.best_score_)
📌 Notes
The code uses the prefix xgb__ to refer to the XGBClassifier in the pipeline when setting the grid.

Ensure your input data is clean and well-formatted before running the tuning process.

🧠 Author
This notebook is authored and maintained as part of a machine learning model tuning workflow. If you're reusing this code, make sure to adapt the pipeline and parameter grid according to your dataset and model choice.
